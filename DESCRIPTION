Description: Fits boundary line models to datasets as proposed by Webb
    (1972) <doi:10.1080/00221589.1972.11514472> and makes statistical
    inferences about their parameters. Provides additional tools for
    testing datasets for evidence of boundary presence and selecting
    initial starting values for model optimization prior to fitting the
    boundary line models. It also includes tools for conducting post-hoc
    analyses such as predicting boundary values and identifying the most
    limiting factor (Miti, Milne, Giller, Lark (2024)
    <doi:10.1016/j.fcr.2024.109365>). This ensures a comprehensive
    analysis for datasets that exhibit upper boundary structures.
