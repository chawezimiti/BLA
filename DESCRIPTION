Description: Tools to fit a boundary line model (Webb, 1972) to a data set
    and make statistical inferences about its parameters. It tests a data
    set for evidence of boundary presence, fit a boundary line model and
    conduct post-hoc analysis e.g. prediction of boundary values and the
    most limiting factor.
