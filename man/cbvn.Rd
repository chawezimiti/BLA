A list of length 5 consisting of the fitted model, equation form,
  parameters of the boundary line, AIC (for boundary line model and a null model)
  and a hessian matrix.  Additionally, a graphical representation of the boundary
  line on the scatter plot is produced.

\description{
This function fits a response model to the upper limits  of a scatter plot of
of \code{x} and \code{y} to determine the most efficient response of \code{y}
as a function of \code{x} (given a measurement error of \code{y}) based on a
censored distribution (Milne et al., 2016). The location of censor in the data
cloud is determined based on the maximum likelihood approach. This is done using
optimization procedure and hence requires some starting guess parameters for the
proposed model. It then compares the results with an uncensored normal bivariate
distribution to access the appropriateness of the censored model.

\details{
Some inbuilt models are available for the \code{cbvn()} function. The suggest model
forms are as follows: \enumerate{
 \item Linear model (\code{"blm"})
 \deqn{y=\beta_1 + \beta_2x}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is the intercept and \eqn{\beta_2} is the slope.

 \item Linear plateau model (\code{"lp"})
 \deqn{y= {\rm min}(\beta_1+\beta_2x, \beta_0)}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is the intercept , \eqn{\beta_2} is the slope  and \eqn{\beta_0}
 is the maximum response.

 \item The logistic (\code{"BL_logistic"}) and inverse logistic (\code{"BL_inv-logistic"})
 models
 \deqn{ y= \frac{\beta_0}{1+e^{\beta_2(\beta_1-x)}}}
 \deqn{ y= \beta_0 - \frac{\beta_0}{1+e^{\beta_2(\beta_1-x)}}}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is a scaling parameter , \eqn{\beta_2} is a shape parameter
 and \eqn{\beta_0} is the maximum response.

 \item Logistic model (\code{"BL_logisticfm"})  (Fermont et al. 2009)
 \deqn{ y= \frac{\beta_0}{1+(\beta_1 \times e^{-\beta_2x})}}
  where \eqn{\beta_1} is a scaling parameter, \eqn{\beta_2} is a shape
  parameter and \eqn{\beta_0} is the maximum response.

 \item Double logistic model (\code{"BL_double-logistic"})
 \deqn{ y= \frac{\beta_{0,1}}{1+e^{\beta_2(\beta_1-x)}} -
 \frac{\beta_{0,2}}{1+e^{\beta_4(\beta_3-x)}}}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is a scaling parameter one, \eqn{\beta_2} is a shape parameter one,
 \eqn{\beta_{0,1}} and \eqn{\beta_{0,2}} are the maximum response ,
 \eqn{\beta_3} is a scaling parameter two and  \eqn{\beta_4} is a shape parameter two.

 \item Quadratic model (\code{"qd"})
 \deqn{y=\beta_1 + \beta_2x + \beta_3x^2}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is a constant, \eqn{\beta_2} is a linear coefficient
 and  \eqn{\beta_3} is the quadratic coefficient.

 \item Trapezium model (\code{"trapezium"})
 \deqn{y={\rm min}(\beta_1+\beta_2x, \beta_0, \beta_3 + \beta_4x)}
 where  \eqn{\beta_1} is the intercept one, \eqn{\beta_2} is the slope one,
 \eqn{\beta_0} is the maximum response, \eqn{\beta_3} is the intercept two
 and \eqn{\beta_3} is the slope two.

 \item Mitscherlich model (\code{"mit"})
 \deqn{y= \beta_0 + \beta_1(1-e^{\frac{-x}{\beta_2}})}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is the intercept, \eqn{\beta_2} is a shape parameter
 and \eqn{\beta_0} is the maximum response.

 \item Schmidt model (\code{"schmidt"})
 \deqn{y= \beta_0 + \beta_1(x-\beta_2)^2}
 where \eqn{\beta_1} is ascaling parameter, \eqn{\beta_2} is a
 shape parameter (x-value at maximum response ) and \eqn{\beta_0} is the
 maximum response .

The function \code{cbvn()} utilities the optimization procedure of the
\code{optim()} function to determine the model parameters. There is a tendency
for optimization algorithms to settle at a local optimum. To remove the risk of
settling for local optimum parameters, it is advised that the function is run using
several starting values and the results with the smallest likelihood (or AIC)
can be taken as a representation of the global optimum.
