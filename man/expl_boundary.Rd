\title{Testing evidence of boundary existence in dataset}
\usage{
expl_boundary(
  x,
  y,
  shells = 10,
  simulations = 1000,
  method = "sd-enclidean",
  plot = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of values for the independent variable.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of values for the response variable.}

\item{shells}{A numeric value indicating the number of boundary peels
(default is 10).}

\item{simulations}{The number of simulations for the null bivariate normally
distributed data sets used to test the hypothesis (default is 1000).}

\item{method}{This describes the measure of boundary points compaction. The methods
include \code{"sd-enclidean"} for the euclidean distance standard deviation of the
each boundary point to the center of data, \code{"Area"} for the perimeter around
the boundary points and \code{"Perimeter"} for the area covering the boundary points.}

\item{plot}{If \code{TRUE}, a plot is part of the output. If \code{FALSE}, plot
is not part of output (default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters as with the \code{par()} function.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the measures of peel compaction in the left and right
  sections of the data with their corresponding probability values.
}
\description{
This function determines the probability of having bounding effects in a scatter
plot of of \code{x} and \code{y} based on the clustering of points at the upper
edge of the scatter plot (Miti et al.2024). It tests the hypothesis of larger
clustering at the upper bounds of a scatter plot against a null bivariate normal
distribution with no bounding effect (random scatter at upper edges). It returns
the probability (p-value) of the observed clustering given that it a realization
of an unbounded bivariate normal distribution.
}
\details{
It is recommended that any outlying observations, as identified by the
\code{bagplot()} function of the \code{aplpack} package are removed from
the data. This is also implemented in the simulation step in the
\code{expl_boundary()} function.

\examples{
x<-evapotranspiration$`ET(mm)`
y<-evapotranspiration$`yield(t/ha)`
expl_boundary(x,y,10,100) # recommendation is to set simulations to greater than 1000
