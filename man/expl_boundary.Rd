\title{Testing evidence of boundary existence in dataset}
\usage{
expl_boundary(x, y, shells = 10, simulations = 1000, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of values for the independent variable.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector of values for the response variable.}

\item{shells}{A numeric value indicating the number of boundary peels
(default is 10).}

\item{simulations}{The number of simulations for the null bivariate normally
distributed data sets used to test the hypothesis (default is 1000).}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters as with the \code{par()} function.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with the p-values of obtaining the observed standard deviation
  of the euclidean distances of vertices in the upper peels to the center of the
  dataset for the left and right sections of the dataset.
}
\description{
This function determines the probability of having bounding effects in a scatter
plot of of \code{x} and \code{y} based on the clustering of points at the upper
edge of the scatter plot (Miti et al.2024). It tests the hypothesis of larger
clustering at the upper bounds of a scatter plot against a null bivariate normal
distribution with no bounding effect (random scatter at upper edges). It returns
the probability (p-value) of the observed clustering given that it a realization
of an unbounded bivariate normal distribution.
}
\details{
It is recommended that any outlying observations, as identified by the
\code{bagplot()} function of the \code{aplpack} package are removed from
the data. This is also implemented in the simulation step in the
\code{expl_boundary()} function.
